### 🚀 Projects that Showcase My Work

I believe the best way to demonstrate knowledge is through practical application. Here are two of my key projects:

- **Students' Social Media Addiction Analysis:** This project is a deep dive into data science. It involves collecting and meticulously cleaning a dataset to analyze social media usage patterns among students. My work on this project includes **training and testing data models** to uncover insights, which is a fundamental skill in machine learning. You can view the full project and its code at the [Students' Social Media Addiction](https://github.com/AaditiG1/Students-Social-Media-Addiction) repository.
- **GUWA Cosmetics E-commerce Website:** This project allowed me to apply my full-stack skills. I built an e-commerce platform for makeup products, which involved front-end design with **HTML/CSS** 🎨, back-end logic, and database integration. It's a great example of how I can translate a concept into a fully functional and user-friendly application. The code is available at the [GUWACosmetics](https://github.com/AaditiG1/GUWACosmetics) repository.
